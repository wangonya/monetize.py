# pymonetize
pymonetize is a tool that allows python web developers to easily add [Monetization](https://webmonetization.org/) to their projects. It does this in two ways:
1. Automatically generating a small js library and including it in your project.
2. Providing an easy to use Python binding for the Web Monetization [Javascript API](https://webmonetization.org/docs/api).
